## Things to do
* Check for large energy kicks not only in the 02_28_2020 file, but also in the others
* Check how nonlinearity of rf affects slow phase component --- does it agree with the experiment? Find the nonlinearity term, is it just the series component of the Taylor series?
* do convolution for the synchrotron motion amplitude instead of rms, the baseline table should be removed
